Evidence remodel (0.9.0).

- **Core**: `ReadingRecord` becomes one artifact row + embedded `beliefs[]` (per-belief Rung/Result/magnitudeBand/Grading justification/strength) with an `assumptionIds` projection and a row-level `body`; beliefs carry optional `sourceReadingId`/`reviewNote` provenance. Confidence gains a `commitmentFactor` (found evidence weighted below committed-experiment evidence; Rung stays the dominant term). New `Archived` experiment status. New `unlink` path (arrayRemove both ends) in the adapter + API.
- **Guardrails / ontology / skills**: "one reading ↔ one belief" → one reading, many beliefs (per-`(belief, source)` dedupe); "evidence must be external" rule + tightened `find-evidence` provenance; `experiment-design` merge mode; all three connector guides aligned.
- **Dashboard**: per-belief verdict list; archived experiments hidden entirely (no toggle); Markdown `body`/quote (zero-dependency renderer); Source/Date/Quote columns; pipeline stage = evidence≠tested (derived from live experiments, not readings).
