# The weekly ritual

The method runs on a light cadence — two anchor points a week. Everything
else (grilling new assumptions, prepping meetings, logging evidence as it
appears) happens ad hoc through the skills.

> **First run — seed the register.** Before the first Monday, do an opening
> evidence sweep: with `/find-evidence`, log what you already know about each
> `Live` belief — even low-rung (`Opinion`, `Anecdotal`, one desk-research
> citation). This differentiates Confidence across the register from t=0, so
> Risk spreads out and the surface has a real top — instead of every row
> sitting at the no-evidence prior (Confidence 0) and Risk collapsing to
> Derived Impact for all of them.

## Monday — prioritise the week's tests

Confidence, Derived Impact, and Risk are all **derived**, so refresh the
numbers before ranking, then read the two surfaces the register computes.

1. **Recompute.** Run the weekly Impact-propagation script: it walks the
   dependency graph and writes each row's `Derived Impact` (seed +
   propagated pull from dependents and standing decisions; committed plans
   never contribute); Confidence and Risk recompute off it. Derived Impact is
   stale between runs *by design* — re-run on demand after any seed-Impact
   override or graph edit (`../skills/_shared/assumption-guardrails.md` §3).
2. **Read the test-next surface** — candidate experiments on `Live` rows,
   ranked by `Feasibility × the linked belief's Risk`, cheapest honest test
   of the riskiest belief on top. It ranks **experiments, not beliefs**, and
   it is **commitment-agnostic**: every `Live` row's experiments compete on
   the same two axes, committed-plan-linked or not. Sanity-check the top —
   does the ranking reflect reality, or is a stale seed Impact distorting
   it? (Fixing the seed and re-running step 1 now is cheaper than a week
   testing the wrong thing.)
3. **Clear the kill lane first.** Any `Live` row at Confidence ≤ −50
   (evidence has stacked against it) is *out of the test slot* and into a
   **human kill review**: affirm the `Invalidated` verdict or write down why
   the belief survives (`../skills/_shared/register-audit.md`). Never an
   automatic flip; never a fresh test slot spent on it.
4. **Check against Running committed plans.** For each `Running` experiment
   carrying a `Deadline`, are the beliefs it rests on actually surfacing near
   the top and being tested? A committed plan whose beliefs nobody is
   testing is a quiet gamble (`goals.md`). A committed plan doesn't lift its
   beliefs in the queue — it never touches Impact — so use the per-plan view
   to pull them up and test them deliberately; don't wait for the global
   ranking to surface them.
5. **Commit the week's tests.** For the top 1–3 experiments, run
   `/experiment-design` (or confirm the already-`Running` ones are actually
   moving).
6. **Mine the calendar.** For each meaningful external conversation, run
   `/meeting-prep` — every meeting is a chance to move a high-Risk belief.

## Friday — conclude and decide

1. **Conclude experiments.** For each test that ran this week, render the
   human verdict against its pre-registered bar: Validated / Invalidated /
   Inconclusive. Never auto-flip on a threshold; never leave a finished
   test `Running` (that's `/find-evidence`'s close-out flow — it flips the
   record in place and Confidence rolls up). On the assumption, a
   validating verdict moves nothing but Confidence; only a kill — a
   conclusive Invalidated at a rung at or above the row's strongest
   validating rung, human-affirmed — flips the row `Live → Invalidated`.
2. **Sweep for stale, mooted, and unclosed experiments.** Run the
   experiment-lifecycle sweeps (`../skills/_shared/register-audit.md`
   Phase E). Surface **kill candidates** — a plan stuck `Running` with no
   reading activity, one whose belief went `Derived Impact` 0 or merged away,
   one superseded by a cheaper same-belief design, or one whose cost
   ballooned past its design-time `Feasibility` — and walk each to a human
   kill-or-continue call (a kill closes unmet bars `Inconclusive`; concluded
   readings survive). Then the **closure audit**: any plan whose
   pre-registered N is met but never closed, and any closed plan missing a
   per-belief bar verdict or its rollup report. The sweep only surfaces; the
   kill and the closure verdict stay human
   (`../skills/_shared/experiment-guardrails.md` §6).
3. **Log the week's stray evidence.** Anything heard in calls, threads, or
   research that bears on an open assumption: `/find-evidence`.
4. **Log the week's decisions.** Anything the team actually decided:
   `/decisions` (Capture for the ones you remember; an occasional Sweep
   over the week's transcripts catches the rest).
5. **Tend the committed plans.** Any committed plan (a `Running` experiment
   carrying a `Deadline`) past its deadline gets closed out via
   `/find-evidence` — human verdict against the pre-registered bars,
   decomposed per belief into evidence (`goals.md`). Any risk-acceptance
   past its `revisit by` date with the belief still untested gets walked
   with the plan's owner: test now, re-accept with a new date, or re-cut the
   plan via `/experiment-design`.
6. **Clear the human-review queue.** If a loop/batch run grilled records
   this week, walk the `Human review` gaps with each record's owner — the
   gap holds machine-grilled records in `Draft`, and only a gated sign-off
   promotes them to `Live` (and so onto the surface).

## Monthly-ish — audit

Run `/assumptions` (audit mode) and `/decisions` (Audit) for a read-only
health report: duplicates, contradictions, orphaned records, incomplete
decisions, stale tensions, and seed Impact justifications that lean on a
committed plan (a plan never anchors Impact) — plus committed-plan health via
`/find-evidence` (audit): overdue risk-acceptance revisit dates, gambles
taken with no line written down, tripwires nobody answered, committed plans
past their deadline still open, outcomes closed without being decomposed,
and anchor dilution. `/assumptions` (audit) also runs the experiment-lifecycle
sweeps
(`../skills/_shared/register-audit.md` Phase E) with the plans loaded, so this
is where the lower-churn **source canonical-link drift** sweep lands: two
spellings of one artifact against the normalization rule, and pasted-artifact
primaries that belong at a link in the "Raw evidence" home. Fix the top
findings through the gated flows.

The point of the cadence: **the register reorders itself.** Evidence *for* a
belief lifts its Confidence and lowers its Risk; evidence *against* it lowers
Confidence and *raises* Risk — so the belief's next test climbs back up the
surface (and once Confidence hits ≤ −50, into Monday's kill lane instead).
Either way Monday's surface is always fresh, and Friday's verdicts are always
against bars set before the data came in.
