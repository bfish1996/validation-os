# Conclude mode — closing a plan, and reading its outcome back as evidence

Closing an Experiment is the joint that earns the rest — most of all for a
**committed (Market-grade)** plan. A plan that closes without being read back
onto its beliefs is an OKR ceremony: the scoreboard updates, the register
learns nothing, and the next commitment gets made on the same stale beliefs.

**The one hard gate in this file lives here** — and note what it gates. It
does not stop you *designing* a plan or *missing* its bar. It stops you
closing a committed plan as `Achieved`/`Missed` without decomposing the
outcome. Everything the method spends on a commitment is repaid at this
step. A Testing-grade plan (no Deadline) closes the same way, minus the
Outcome field — its bar verdicts alone are the report.

## Read first

`../../../docs/goals.md §Out` (and §Found numbers, for banking). The deadline read of
a telemetry / scoreboard number runs under
`../../_shared/quant-analytics-rubric.md` — re-validating the instrument via
`../../_shared/analytics-metric-resolution.md` first. **Decomposition runs
in-skill here**, using the shared evidence procedure
`../../_shared/historic-evidence.md`. Gate: `../../_shared/gated-writes.md`.

## Entry

The Deadline passed, the user asks to close a plan, or `references/audit.md`
surfaced an unclosed one.

## Phases

1. **Read the bars.** Both, from the record's bar line(s), before looking at
   the result — `We're right if` and `We're wrong if` as they were fixed at
   commit. If a bar was edited after the plan moved to `Running`, stop and
   say so: the instrument was tampered with and the outcome can't be read as
   evidence.

2. **Get the measured result** from the named instrument — ask the human, or
   read it if the source is connected. **If the instrument is a telemetry /
   scoreboard number**, re-validate its resolved mapping
   (`../../_shared/analytics-metric-resolution.md` — schemas drift) and read
   it under `../../_shared/quant-analytics-rubric.md`. The segment,
   denominator, and window were **fixed at commit time** — reading any of
   them differently now to clear the bar is the same tampering as editing a
   bar; a read that can't clear the rubric caps at **Inconclusive**.

3. **Set `Closure reason`** (Completed / Early-stop / Kill) and, **for a
   committed plan**, take the **`Outcome`** — from the human.
   `Achieved` / `Missed` / `Dropped`, read against the pre-registered bars.
   Never inferred from a threshold, never auto-flipped. Where the result
   sits between the two bars, say so plainly and let them call it.

4. **Decompose — the hard gate** (`Achieved`/`Missed` only). The outcome must
   be read back onto the linked beliefs as **one `beliefs[]` entry per bar
   line** (typically on a single Reading representing the plan's outcome —
   never fan one artifact into several Readings), run **in-skill** here — the
   shared evidence procedure (`../../_shared/historic-evidence.md`), same
   gates. This is the **one case that sets `experimentId`**: the readings are
   the direct output of executing this committed plan, so each links the
   closing Experiment as its origin (`commitmentFactor` 1.0).
   `/find-evidence` owns this end to end; it is not a `/experiment-design`
   job.
   - A hit is revealed-tier evidence for the beliefs underneath — real
     commitment, really given.
   - A miss usually invalidates one belief specifically. Find which. "We
     missed" is a scoreboard fact; "we missed *because* ASM-15 was wrong" is
     what the register is for.
   - **Grade each entry by interpolation**, not a threshold flip: hit/beat
     `We're right if` → full positive; at/below `We're wrong if` → negative;
     between → a partial positive at the magnitude (`Magnitude band`) of what
     materialised (absolute anchors, `experiment-guardrails.md §2`).
   - **First close of a found-number plan banks the discovered truth — once.**
     The standing level (the 15 customers that already exist at the deadline)
     reads as an interpolated positive at the magnitude of what materialised.
     One time only; the ratchet
     (`../../experiment-design/references/commitment-discipline.md`) stops
     the next cycle re-banking an unchanged world.
   - **Each closed cycle is its own aggregation unit** — cycle readings on
     the same instrument **never dedupe**
     (`experiment-guardrails.md §2`), so a series of misses can accumulate
     toward the kill zone instead of collapsing to one.
   - **A committed plan cannot close as Achieved/Missed with zero per-belief
     `beliefs[]` entries** across the readings linking it (`outcome-unread`,
     `../../_shared/ontology.yaml`). If the user wants to skip it, that is a
     refusal to close: leave the plan `Running`, say why, and offer to come
     back to it.

5. **`Dropped` instead.** Exempt from decomposition — a plan abandoned
   because the world changed has nothing to read back, and forcing a fake
   evidence row is worse than nothing. Requires the superseding record, or a
   one-line reason the plan stopped mattering. **Dropped emits no
   evidence**: only a plan that actually closed against its bars reads.

6. **Write the close-out.** `Closure reason`, `Outcome` (if committed), date,
   the measured number, a one-line cause, and links to the evidence
   readings (or the superseding record). Lifecycle → `Closed`.

7. **Let the loop run.** A miss's negative readings drop the underlying
   beliefs' Confidence; the queue routes them back into testing on the
   ordinary flow. No new machinery, nothing to do by hand.

Nothing else changes mechanically: no assumption Status flips, no Impact
edits. Linked rows keep competing on their own Risk — their queue membership
never depended on this plan. Stale plan-anchored Impact justifications are
`references/audit.md`'s job (`stale-seed-anchor`).

## Gate

Gated write (`../../_shared/gated-writes.md`). Decomposition writes evidence
readings **before** the close-out card, as sequential cards — the plan
closes last, once the learning is actually recorded.

## Never

- Never auto-flip an Outcome from a threshold. The human reads the bars.
- Never close a committed plan Achieved/Missed without per-belief
  decomposition — the gate exists for exactly the moment the user is in a
  hurry.
- Never let a Dropped plan emit evidence.
- Never rewrite a bar to match the outcome. If the bar was wrong, the plan
  was superseded mid-cycle or it wasn't — and if it wasn't, the miss is
  real.
